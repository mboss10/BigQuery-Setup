# BigQuery Setup and first steps

## Context

This is a mini knowledge base article to help me document how to get started with a free trial Google Cloud account, access BigQuery and take the first steps using it via a project.


### Account creation and setup

Here is the URL to get started: [https://cloud.google.com/bigquery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)

Click "Get started for free".
When you sign up for BigQuery, you're going to create a free account which will give you $300 dollars in free credits. You have to put in credit card information but it will not bill you until you manually upgrade. So if you go over this $300 in free credits you're not going to get billed, Google will simply cancel your account. 
This means we can use BigQuery during a trial period basically risk-free, without having to worry about getting charged.

You need a Gmail account or a Google account. More details [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en)


It automatically creates "My First Project" for you and it will just randomly generate this project ID. 
How bigquery works:
* Projects
  * Data Sets - which are kind of like folders
    * SQL tables and Views underneath those data sets
