# BigQuery-Setup

## Context

This is a mini knowledge base article to help me document how to get started with a free trial Google Cloud account and access BigQuery.

When you sign up for bigquery, you're going to create a free account which will give you $300 dollars in free credits. You have to put in credit card information but it will not bill you until you manually upgrade. So if you go over this $300 in free credits you're not going to get billed, it'll simply cancel your account. 
This means we can use BigQuery during a trial period basically risk-free, without having to worry about getting charged.
